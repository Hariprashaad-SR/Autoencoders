# Autoencoders

An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture designed to efficiently compress (encode) input data down to its essential features, then reconstruct (decode) the original input from this compressed representation.

Autoencoder is made up of two components:

1. **Encoder**: It works as a compression unit that compresses the input data.
2. **Decoder**: It decompresses the compressed input by reconstructing it.

## Types of Autoencoders

Autoencoders are flexible neural networks that can be customized for various tasks. They come in different forms, each with unique strengths and limitations.

1. Vanilla Autoencoders
2. Denoising Autoencoders
3. Sparse Autoencoders
4. Contractive Autoencoders
5. Variational Autoencoders.

## Applications of Autoencoders

Three are several applications of Autoencoders some of the important ones are:

1. File Compression
2. Image De-noising
3. Image Transformation
